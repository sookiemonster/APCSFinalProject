**3.** Brief Description  
LiteRoom (our version of Adobe’s Lightroom) is an image editing program that’s useful for color correction and color grading. Within the program there will be sliders that can be used to adjust certain aspects of the image, as well as a graph representing data from the image.

### Development Log

5/24/2021  
Daniel - Created all the Slider subclasses necessary for proof of concept and made sure they generally work.  
Jonathan - Created a Navigator class as well as two buttons necessary for loading and saving images. I also worked on resizing an image if it was larger than the editor in our program. I also made it allow to process one image at a time an infinite amount of time.

5/25/2021
Jonathan - Enhanced the load and saving buttons by adding error messages when the user performs an invalid action.

Daniel - Added HSL to RGB conversions for sliders & added label option to WindowObjects. Fixed merge conflicts between jBranch & dBranch and updated demo & main branches.
